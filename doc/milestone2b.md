# cs107-FinalProject Milestone 2b

1. Tasks each group member has been assigned to for Milestone2

Raymond J: Configure TravisCI to run tests on basic operations on the spladtool_forward.tensor class.  Fix any bugs on the dunder methods implemented in the tensor class and make sure the forward mode calculations and gradients adhere to the input data type dimensionality.  



2. What has each group member done since Milestone 1

Raymond J: Wrote tests for all basic operations.  Added a comparison operator to compare tensor class objects in the unittests.  Configured the travis.yml file to run tests in tests module.  Restructured spladtool_forward into /lib and /tests module.
